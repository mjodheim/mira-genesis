# Mira Genesis — current authoritative project state

**Updated: 6 September 2026 — M124/H69 closed without replay; H69 untested.**

This is the reader-facing navigation and interpretation snapshot. Frozen experiment records,
immutable results, `DECISIONS.md`, experiment-local evidence and the machine-readable
`PROJECT_STATE.yaml` remain authoritative for their own claims and chronology.

The superseded 2 September/M120 snapshot is preserved byte-for-byte at
[`docs/state-history/PROJECT_STATE_PRE_SYNC_2026-09-05.md`](docs/state-history/PROJECT_STATE_PRE_SYNC_2026-09-05.md).
Nothing historical is rewritten by this synchronization.

## Current answer

The latest merged carrier milestone is **M124/H69**. It is **closed at DEVELOPMENT readiness without
replay and H69 is UNTESTED**. No qualifying scientific generation ran, no carrier bank was built and
no generality gate moved.

The recent apparatus-convergence line now reads:

- M119 spent one qualifying generation before discovering an inadequate carrier bank;
- M120 moved the analogous contract problem into readiness and exposed the route's five-level
  array-of-object enforcement ceiling against an eight-level candidate contract;
- M122 flattened the contract and observed 9/9 required capability classes conforming, but its
  stress completed at 30,957 tokens against the inherited 32,000 threshold;
- M123 replaced the one-point sizing assumption with an empirical rate envelope. Its prospectively
  selected 109-station stress returned 50,232 tokens inside the recorded 45,598–65,698 envelope,
  but the body was incomplete/malformed JSON and the frozen ladder closed `not_ready_stress`;
- M124 prospectively classified content-bearing responses with no `finish_reason` as delivery rather
  than scientific outcomes. Its decisive stress instead returned HTTP 200 with no completion content,
  so the new rule was not exercised. The preserved verdict is `not_ready_delivery`.

Post-observation review of M124 identified instrument defects that are **not** applied retrospectively:
unbounded non-target probe dimensions, a `Retry-After` field mismatch, inconsistent empty-HTTP-200
retry semantics, spurious truncation attribution and verdict-precedence ambiguity. The owner chose on
5 September 2026 to close M124 without replay. Those defects are requirements for a new prospective
successor, not reasons to rescore M124.

## Scientific status

The 2026-09-05 independent validation sweep is recorded in
[`docs/audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_MATRIX_2026-09-05.json`](docs/audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_MATRIX_2026-09-05.json).
The original matrix is preserved unchanged. Its H39 status conflated reproduction of M094's positive
qualification verdict with acceptance of a registered scientific claim; the navigation correction is
recorded separately in
[`docs/audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_CORRIGENDUM_2026-09-05.json`](docs/audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_CORRIGENDUM_2026-09-05.json).
H39 therefore remains **owner-pending with no register claim** while D063 is unfilled. Replay is
reproduction, not new scientific evidence.

Recent validated navigation:

| Milestone | Hypothesis | Current interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M105 | H50 | **not supported**; preserved negative reproduced |
| M106 | H51 | supported within frozen bounds; scientific predicates reproduce, stable projection has an absolute-path portability limit |
| M107 | H52 | supported within frozen bounds; positive 16/16 reproduced byte-stably |
| M108 | H53 | supported within frozen bounds; positive 16/16 reproduced byte-stably |
| M109 | H54 | supported within frozen bounds; positive 18/18 reproduced byte-stably |
| M110 | H55 | supported within frozen bounds; positive 24/24 reproduced byte-stably |
| M111 | H56 | supported within frozen bounds; positive 24/24 reproduced byte-stably |
| M112 | H57 | mixed; procedure 10/10, diagnosis 24/24 positive, transfer 22/24 negative |

H58–H65 and H67–H69 remain **untested** instrument/readiness closures. They do not accumulate into a
scientific negative and advance no generality gate.

## Carrier frontier M113–M124

| Milestone | H | Closure | Scientific consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M113 | H58 | transport/instrument failure | untested |
| M114 | H59 | transport/capacity abort | untested |
| M115 | H60 | strict-JSON admission aborted before carrier payload | untested |
| M116 | H61 | route unsuitable for required structured-output classes | untested |
| M117 | H62 | route qualification / calibration only | untested |
| M118 | H63 | apparatus design/audit stopped before generation | untested |
| M119 | H64 | one generation; bank inadequate before arms | untested |
| M120 | H65 | readiness closure; 8-level candidate vs 5-level route | untested |
| M122 | H67 | `not_ready_stress`; contract validated 9/9, 30,957/32,000 tokens | untested |
| M123 | H68 | frozen `not_ready_stress`; sizing landed in envelope, response body incomplete | untested |
| M124 | H69 | preserved `not_ready_delivery`; owner closed without replay | untested |

Across the bounded delivery allowance, **4 of 6 delivery attempts have now been spent**. M124 used 11
of its 30 request budget and left 19 unused. The counter is not reset by opening a successor.

## Separate long-horizon frontier — M121/H66

M121/H66 targets a bounded part of G7 (long-horizon autonomy). Its public preregistration/design now
has recorded owner disposition **P-025 / `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION`**. That resolves the
publication/IP gate only.

The hostile review and a non-canonical prospective v2 candidate remain public:

- [`docs/audits/M121_PREIMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW_2026-09-05.md`](docs/audits/M121_PREIMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW_2026-09-05.md)
- [`docs/audits/M121_V2_DESIGN_CANDIDATE_2026-09-05.md`](docs/audits/M121_V2_DESIGN_CANDIDATE_2026-09-05.md)

Prospective v2 hardening may proceed, but **no canonical salt, one-shot scientific execution, reveal or
result acceptance is authorized by P-025**. A future positive H66 result would still be bounded
partial evidence and would not close G7 by itself.

## Other open scientific gates

- **M092/H38** remains unresolved and `first_run_only`. Static integrity work is safe; advancing its
  canonical cursor requires explicit owner authority.
- **M094/H39** has a preserved positive qualification verdict that reproduces, but **D063 remains
  unfilled**, so no H39 register claim is accepted by this navigation.
- **H21/M075** remains externally blocked on a private human-maintained bank and separate-maintainer
  reproduction.
- **H31/M085** remains externally blocked on an independently maintained cross-domain bank/protocol
  and independent reproduction.

Those external conditions cannot be satisfied by an internal, owner-authored or AI-authored
replacement while retaining the original claims.

## Publication/IP governance

The recent publication backlog has been reconciled transparently, without backdating:

| Ledger | Milestone | Disposition | Decision date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P-024 | M120 / H65 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-025 | M121 / H66 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-026 | M123 / H68 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-027 | M122 / H67 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-028 | M124 / H69 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |

The authoritative reconciliation is
[`docs/IP_REVIEWS/OWNER_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-05.md`](docs/IP_REVIEWS/OWNER_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-05.md).
These are publication/release decisions; they do not manufacture scientific results or authorize the
separate canonical gates listed above.

## Claim boundary

Mira Genesis does **not** currently claim AGI, general intelligence, consciousness, unrestricted
self-rewrite, open-ended evolution, open-ended recursive self-improvement, unrestricted repository
authority or unrestricted network authority. Positive results remain bounded results under their
frozen contracts.

## Next safe actions

1. Treat M124 as closed; do not replay or rescore it.
2. Any carrier successor must be newly numbered and prospectively freeze the M124 defect corrections,
   preserve the 4/6 delivery ceiling and use fresh calibration for any redesigned stress schema.
3. Never fill H58–H69 retrospectively from instrument artifacts.
4. M121 may be hardened prospectively, but keep its canonical salt/run/reveal owner-gated.
5. Keep M092's canonical cursor paused absent explicit owner authority.
6. Preserve genuine external-independence requirements for H21 and H31.
