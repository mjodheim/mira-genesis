"""Launch one Genesis lineage and render what it did. The sequencing belongs to the runtime.

This is the DEVELOPMENT demonstration the stopping criterion in
``docs/METAMORPHOSIS_TARGET.md`` asks for: not that the components exist, but that **one lineage**
does all of it. It is not a scientific result, it is not frozen, and it advances no gate. Every
mechanism it exercises is already qualified in a bounded setting; what is new is that they run as one
program.

**What changed, and why it mattered.** This script used to *be* the architecture. It called the
probe functions itself, assigned ``genesis.state`` for every vocabulary and component growth,
appended the corresponding journal entries, invoked the migration and chose each proposal in order.
The primitives ran in one process, but the sequencing the objective is actually about lived in a
host script — so what the run demonstrated was that a person can call the pieces in the right order.

Now the file supplies three things and nothing else:

* a **world**: the task family, the demands the lineage may investigate, the substrate it may
  discover, the operation registry probes are composed from, and the artifacts it may name;
* a **mechanism**: a function from the frozen ``LineageContext`` to one declarative intent;
* a **renderer** for the record the controller returns.

It assigns no lineage state, appends no journal entry, and runs no probe. `genesis.controller` does
all of that, which is what makes the observe→diagnose→propose→evaluate→adopt→persist→continue loop a
property of the runtime rather than of whoever wrote the driver.

Run it with ``--write`` to persist the record under ``experiments/GENESIS/``.
