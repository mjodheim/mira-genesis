"""Structural repository guardrails.

Four real defects motivated this script. The first three were invisible to sealed
evaluation workflows because those workflows executed only selected test files:

1. `metamorphosis/core.py` imported `torch`, which made the documented `pytest -q`
   command fail on every machine without PyTorch;
2. roughly 2,400 lines formed a completely disconnected import subgraph without any
   signal exposing it;
3. `pyproject.toml` declared `torch` and `scipy`, although neither was imported;
4. sixteen commits cited by SHA in the registers — among them M042's frozen protocol,
   the M050-M052 development results and M094's own freeze commit — were reachable
   from no ref at all, so routine branch cleanup or garbage collection would have made
   those citations unresolvable while leaving the record looking intact.

Each check is independent and may be run on its own.
