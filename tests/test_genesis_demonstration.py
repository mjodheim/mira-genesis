"""Lock the end-to-end Genesis demonstration.

The stopping criterion is not that the components exist. It is that **one lineage** measures itself,
diagnoses itself, transforms itself, verifies the transformation, adopts or rejects it on evidence,
keeps what it learned, extends the machinery that enables later transformations, changes form, and
goes on evolving in the new form. These tests assert each of those on the same run.

They also assert something the earlier version could not: that the *runtime* performs those
transitions. The demonstration script used to call the probes, assign `genesis.state` and append the
journal entries itself, so what the run showed was a person calling the pieces in the right order.
The script now supplies a world, a mechanism that returns declarative intents, and a renderer;
everything below reads a record `genesis.controller.run` produced.
