# Mira Genesis — Adaptive Embodiment

Mira Genesis is a public, auditable research program on **adaptive software lineages**: systems that
can diagnose limitations in their own executable body, construct and validate changes, adopt them
transactionally, preserve useful state across substrate changes, and continue adapting under strict
measurement boundaries.

The project was originated and is directed by **Anthony Mets**.

The project is deliberately narrower than the phrase “self-improving AI” usually suggests. It does
not treat a model rewriting source code as proof that a lineage owns the improvement process. The
research question is instead whether progressively more of the machinery for diagnosis,
transformation, validation, adoption and later improvement can become **lineage-owned, causal and
replayable**.

> **Current frontier:** M095's preserved negative is resolved by M096's exact-contract result;
> M097 qualifies bounded operation acquisition, M099 qualifies hard process-death persistence after
> M098's preserved replay defect, and M100 now qualifies two further cumulative acquisition cycles.
> Its state grows from one registered subtraction to addition and then weighted addition, preserves
> and reuses all three on 9/9 fresh worlds. M101 then qualifies a carrier-neutral acquisition from
> text, its constructive-reach transfer to records and Python syntax versus eight fresh baselines,
> and its live necessity for a later syntax acquisition. M102 adds genuine destructive interference:
> acquired state-owned registry policy K prevents measured forgetting and remains necessary with
> M101 B for later SQLite capability C. Both M101 and M102 pass all 15 frozen conditions.

## What the project is trying to establish

The long-term research target is not “make the benchmark number go up”. It is a causal chain in
which improvements become part of the machinery that makes later improvements possible:

```text
S0
  -> acquire A
S1 has new reach
  -> acquire B using that reach
S2 has new transformation capability
  -> acquire C
...
```

A stronger successor would show that earlier acquisitions improve the **ability to discover later
acquisitions** — for example by exposing missing prerequisites, reducing search cost, improving
selection or extending the transformation language itself.

The current staged objective is:

1. **real self-repair** — diagnose and repair a real repository component without being handed the
   target or finished patch;
2. **improvement enabling improvement** — show that adopting A causally changes whether B is
   reachable;
3. **endogenous language extension in the real-software line** — show that a needed transformation
   lies outside the inherited operation language and that the lineage acquires an extension rather
   than receiving it;
4. **hard persistence** — kill the process and prove the acquired transformation capability returns
   from lineage-owned persisted state;
5. **bounded repeated cumulative cycles** — repeat the causal chain across fresh tasks while
   conserving and reusing earlier operations; M100 qualifies this inside one affine family;
6. **cross-family cumulative transfer** — derive later targets from materially different observed
   demands instead of another preselected target inside the same representation; M101 qualifies
   this across three bounded project-authored carriers;
7. **depth and interference** — retain and extend the chain when later learning can damage earlier
   acquisitions; M102 qualifies this in a bounded project-authored schedule with real SQLite;
8. **acquisition machinery and external pressure** — make an acquired improvement change what later
   acquisition can construct, then move toward independently authored held-out domains.

M091 demonstrated endogenous extension in a bounded abstract setting; M097 brought one acquired
operation into the real-software line, M100 repeated the enabling relation twice, M101 moved the
relation across authored text, record and Python-syntax carriers, and M102 acquired a registry
policy under real forgetting pressure before reusing the chain in SQLite. The current frontier is
whether an acquired state-owned improvement can expand the constructive reach of the acquisition
machinery itself.

## Where the project stands now

| Milestone | Status | Current reading |
|---|---|---|
| M042 | **Positive canonical** | First bounded Genesis completion in deterministic finite DFAs; all ten frozen completion gates passed together. |
| M066 | **Positive canonical** | The same bounded gate structure was confirmed on a CPython → Node ESM → whole-WebAssembly lineage. |
| M091 | **Positive scientific result** | A state-owned transformation language was extended endogenously beyond the inherited language's constructive image. |
| M092 | **Aborted without verdict** | Canonical exhaustive search was stopped voluntarily before terminal candidate, reproduction or qualification. |
| M093 | **Engineering rehearsal** | Real repository transformation, sandbox validation, adoption, persistence and rollback worked, but the target, diagnosis and patch were substantially authored. |
| M094 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | The lineage measured the limiting real component, selected the tied top targets and assembled an executable repair from composable operations; 12/12 conditions passed. |
| M095 | **Negative qualified result — attempt 1** | The development chain works, but 0/6 demand-bearing structural qualification worlds execution-confirm B after A; 3/3 negatives remain negative. Eight of eleven conditions pass; P3/P5/P6 fail. |
| M096 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | Exact closed mapping contracts restore compositional reach: 8/8 positives, 4/4 negatives, and 10/10 conditions independently replayed true. |
| M097 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | The lineage assembled and registered a new binary-expression repair operation; inherited scored 0/4, extended 4/4, and 12/12 conditions replayed true. |
| M098 | **Negative qualified result — attempt 1** | Every direct persistence condition passed, but stable replay retained an aggregate PID list; 11/12 conditions passed and P12 failed. |
| M099 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | The M097 operation survived producer death, ran in isolated fresh consumers on 3/3 new worlds, failed under absence/mutation/corruption, recovered after exact rollback, and replayed 12/12 true. |
| M100 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | Registered subtraction enabled acquisition of addition; registered addition enabled weighted addition; all three remained live on 9/9 fresh worlds and all 12 conditions replayed true. |
| M101 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | A carrier-neutral capability acquired from text added reach on 8/8 held-out text/record/syntax worlds versus 0 hidden passes for eight fresh baselines, then remained a live prerequisite for B; 15/15 conditions replayed true. |
| M102 | **Positive qualified scientific result** | Observable flat-registry collisions caused acquisition of state-owned policy K; K prevented destructive forgetting and remained necessary with M101 B for later SQLite capability C. Real-state, retention, causal-control, rollback and replay checks passed 15/15. |
| M103 | **Protocol frozen; run not authorised; untested** | H48 asks whether an acquired state-owned constructor extension adds later constructive reach beyond S0's closed context-invariant image. The complete apparatus and population are bound by protocol `cb21a4fa…`; no result exists. |

The repository preserves M095's frozen negative attempt 1, M096/M097's positive successors, M098's
disclosed negative, M099's positive hard-persistence result, M100's positive cumulative result and
M101's bounded cross-family result, plus M102's bounded interference result. M100–M102 were developed and qualified locally under the
recorded `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` disposition; remote automation is used only for repository
validation after local evidence is green.

## M094 — original qualified repair anchor

M094 remains the qualified anchor for autonomous diagnosis and repair on the active real-software
line; M096–M102 extend the causal chain beyond it.

Its preserved second attempt produced a **positive** verdict with **12/12 protocol conditions
computed and true**. The mechanism used **zero model calls and zero network calls**. Diagnosis
selected `mira_core/contracts.py` by measurement and repaired both classes tied at the highest
demand, `Goal` and `Observation`.

Qualification was drawn after adoption from the adopted mechanism digest and passed **2/2
cross-component requirements**:

- `AgentResult`, including a computed `@property` alongside declared fields;
- `ContainerSpec`, including a key mapped to a differently named field.

Random-selection and template-only controls closed nothing. More budget over the same operation set
recovered the same mechanism.

M094 also preserves a withdrawn first positive-looking attempt. A post-verdict audit discovered that
rollback had been tested over decoded text and missed CRLF → LF byte normalization. The attempt was
withdrawn instead of retroactively repaired into a success, the storage mechanism was corrected to
adopt and restore bytes, and the second attempt reused the same mechanism and qualification draw.

See `experiments/M094/` and PR #177 for the full evidence.

## M095 — why the current work matters

M095 does not ask whether the lineage can perform two repairs in sequence. It asks whether the first
repair changes the **constructive reach** of the second.

In the development world, the outer repair requires a renderer on an inner value object. At S0 that
renderer does not exist, so the outer repair cannot be built. The lineage repairs the inner object;
after adoption, the **same operation set** can construct the outer repair.

The active audit then found a more interesting selection problem: when the needed enabler was ranked
below the blocked target, a greedy strategy stalled. The failed search already named the operation it
could not apply, and that operation identified the missing supplier. The lineage can now use that
failure as evidence, descend to the lower-ranked enabler, repair it, and retry the blocked target.

That development relation now holds across all six tested demand-bearing arrangements, including
cases where the enabler is initially outranked. Two deliberately negative arrangements remain where
no inner demand exists and therefore no visible enabler exists to descend to.

This remains useful **development evidence**, but qualification is negative. The current M095 line
recorded 31 pre-freeze defects across seven adversarial passes, with 30 repaired and defect 19
disclosed. Attempt 1 then ran all nine frozen entries: 0/6 positives demonstrate the full relation,
3/3 negatives remain negative, and the checker reports eight passes with P3/P5/P6 failed. A's local
renderer may emit extra keys; B's exact nested contract rejects them. No post-verdict repair is made.

M096 then froze a new population and accepted only complete exact output contracts. It demonstrated
8/8 positive relations and preserved 4/4 negative controls; the checker replayed all ten conditions
true. See `experiments/M095/` for the preserved negative and `experiments/M096/` for its successor.

## What has already been completed — and what “complete” means

The project has a frozen **bounded Genesis completion definition** in
[`GENESIS_COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md`](GENESIS_COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md).

M042 was the first continuous lineage to satisfy all ten gates together in the deterministic
binary-DFA laboratory. M066 later supplied a separate bounded real-substrate confirmation.

Those results are complete **inside their declared task, substrate and budget families**. They do
not imply unrestricted self-modification, general intelligence or open-ended evolution.

The active real-software line deliberately asks a stronger question: how much of the improvement
process can become endogenous in a continuing lineage, and whether one acquisition can become a
real prerequisite or tool for the next. M096 establishes contract-safe composition within its
finite authored domain; M097 establishes bounded language extension and M099 establishes hard
process-death persistence after M098's preserved replay-normalisation failure. M100 establishes two
further bounded cumulative acquisition cycles with exact conservation and live dependency. M101
establishes bounded transfer of acquired reach across authored carrier families. M102 establishes
bounded state-owned registry improvement under measured interference and real SQLite execution.
M103 now freezes the acquisition-hypothesis-machinery test without executing it; independently authored
domains, lower-substrate ownership and deeper chains remain open.

## What Mira Genesis does not currently claim

Mira Genesis does **not** currently establish:

- AGI;
- consciousness or sentience;
- unrestricted or open-ended recursive self-improvement;
- arbitrary self-modification;
- superiority to frontier language models;
- autonomous authority over production systems, credentials, networks or deployment;
- that competence supplied by an external model belongs to the endogenous lineage.

Generality language is governed separately by
[`MIRA_GENERALITY_CRITERIA.md`](MIRA_GENERALITY_CRITERIA.md). A bounded mechanism or benchmark score
cannot be promoted into an AGI claim by wording alone.

## Two epistemic tracks

The repository separates two kinds of evidence:

**Endogenous lineage track**

Studies capabilities that belong to lineage state, transformation machinery and executable body.
This is the track relevant to M091 and the current M094/M095 frontier.

**Model-mediated governed-agent track**

Allows a named external model to propose actions while Mira supplies authority control, isolation,
budgets, audit and evaluator-owned success. External-model competence remains attributed to the
composed system, not silently reassigned to Mira.

See [`docs/EPISTEMIC_TRACKS.md`](docs/EPISTEMIC_TRACKS.md).

## Scientific discipline

The repository is intentionally designed so that a failed experiment can remain useful evidence.
Its operating rules include:

- freeze protocols, thresholds and decision rules before the evidence they decide exists;
- keep hidden qualification material outside the mechanism being evaluated;
- execute candidates rather than infer success from structure where behaviour matters;
- preserve negative, withdrawn and disqualified results instead of replacing them;
- distinguish development demonstrations from qualified scientific results;
- use causal controls and ablations that can genuinely come out the other way;
- replay from preserved artifacts and keep provenance resolvable;
- keep release authority outside the self-modifying lineage.

That rule applies to historical claims as well: **M086-A remains POST-HOC DISQUALIFIED** and is not
restored to a positive qualification by later work.

The failure history is not cleanup debt; it is part of the research record. See
[`FAILURE_LOG.md`](FAILURE_LOG.md).

## Safety and authority boundary

Even a scientifically autonomous lineage remains inside an externally controlled release boundary.
Candidate code runs in disposable environments with explicit limits. Scientific autonomy inside a
sandbox does not grant permission to modify production systems, credentials, external networks or
deployment infrastructure.

The long-term research goal does not require making Genesis impossible for humans to stop, inspect or
contain.

## Reproducing the repository checks

The normal development verification path is:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
python scripts/check_repository_integrity.py
```

Individual frozen experiments may require additional commands, runtimes, artifacts or checkers.
Follow the experiment-local protocol rather than treating the generic test suite as a scientific
verdict.
