# Evolvable cognitive machinery — foundation

Status: **DEVELOPMENT engineering design**, 24 September 2026. No scientific claim, no gate movement,
no V22/V22R/V23/V24 result, and no change to the immutable trust root.

## Baseline before this line

This line began immediately after the identity-corrected retained-evaluator V22R replication apparatus
was integrated. It is continuously rebased/merged forward onto the live scientific mainline without
editing frozen evidence.

At branch creation, active work already existed in PRs #332–#336 around V23 replay, repository/state
synchronisation, real-project gate hardening, and prospective L6–L8 RSI apparatus. Later V23/V24 work
has continued independently on main. This line remains orthogonal to those experiments: it does not
edit their frozen evidence, select an RSI outcome, or reuse hidden observations.

The integrated runtime already has several prerequisites this line should preserve rather than rebuild:

- immutable genesis.trust_root separated from mutable Genesis;
- persistent generated program bodies and interpreter-form migration;
- search-policy and MetaPolicy evolution;
- recursive research strategy;
- provenance classes distinguishing lineage-owned, host-written and model-mediated artifacts;
- explicit budget accounting;
- compute proxies that deliberately refuse to masquerade as energy measurements.

## Research question

Can Genesis improve the **machinery that produces cognition**, rather than only search for a better
program inside fixed machinery, while remaining externally measurable and resource-bounded?

The target is not “a larger Transformer”. A Transformer, state-space model, recurrent network,
memory system, router, symbolic module, mixture of specialists, or a future mechanism without a
current name should all be representable as possible descendants. Architecture family must therefore
be mutable data rather than a hard-coded design decision.

A later experiment should optimise a frontier such as:

    capability / reliability / transfer
                   versus
    measured compute / latency / memory / energy when actually instrumented

No scalar “intelligence score” or energy estimate is introduced in this foundation.

## Implemented increments

### Increment 0 — canonical cognitive architecture genome

`genesis/cognitive_architecture.py` provides a canonical, content-addressed graph representation with
externally admitted primitive identifiers, complete configuration in identity, explicit feedforward
and recurrent edges, acyclic within-step dependencies, optional external node/edge bounds and
deterministic structural profiling. It deliberately makes no FLOP, watt, energy, latency,
parameter-count or intelligence inference from topology.

### Increment 1 — executable primitive registry

`genesis/cognitive_executor.py` executes a deliberately small deterministic primitive catalogue under
an externally imposed node-execution ceiling. Recurrent state remains outside the genome. Recurrent
edges have source -> target semantics across logical steps, so recurrent topology changes affect
execution rather than remaining decorative structure. Actual CPU process time is reported only as a
compute proxy; energy remains unavailable unless it is independently instrumented.

### Increment 2 — bounded architecture mutations

`genesis/cognitive_mutation.py` applies explicit externally chosen mutation intents and validates the
result against admitted primitives and externally supplied size bounds. Primitive/config replacement,
node addition/removal and edge addition/removal are implemented. Every applied mutation can emit a
content-addressed `MutationRecord` binding the canonical parent digest, proposal digest and child
digest. Input/output protection, admitted primitive constraints and node/edge ceilings fail closed.

Mutation policy, scoring and scientific selection remain outside this module; the mutation engine
therefore cannot decide that its own descendant is better.

## Boundary that must not move

Mutable Genesis may eventually change topology, primitive selection, memory layout, recurrence,
routing, learning/update rules, mutation operators, architecture search policy and allocation of its
own admitted compute budget.

It must not gain authority over hidden/fresh evaluation cases, correctness grading, final
accept/reject, resource ceilings, measurement provenance, evaluator identity, rollback or integrity
checks. Those remain external or trust-root-governed.

## Planned increments

### Increment 3 — lineage-held architecture search (proposal path implemented)

`genesis/cognitive_search.py` now represents bounded architecture-search policy as canonical,
content-addressed lineage data. A fixed interpreter deterministically enumerates structurally valid
descendants through the bounded mutation engine, deduplicates equal child architectures, skips
retained candidate identities and refuses a policy whose candidate limit or primitive vocabulary
exceeds externally supplied ceilings.

`genesis/cognitive_search_controller.py` binds the seed policy into `LineageState`, runs its proposal
step inside the existing isolation boundary and reconstructs the expected candidate host-side before
returning it. Proposal generation cannot spend the external budget, mutate lineage state, inspect a
grader or emit a verdict. The policy survives checkpoint restoration.

The evaluation/adoption half of Increment 3 remains separate: candidate architectures still need an
external matched-budget measurement record before any descendant may be adopted. That next layer
must preserve the policy/parent/proposal/child identities emitted here and must not move scoring into
the mutable search policy.

### Increment 4 — resource-aware causal adoption (measurement foundation implemented)

`genesis/cognitive_measurement.py` now creates content-addressed external measurement records that bind
architecture, evaluator, case-set and budget identities. Matched comparison refuses changed evaluators,
case sets or budgets and reports capability, node-execution and CPU-process-time deltas without issuing
an adoption verdict. CPU time remains explicitly a compute proxy.

Energy stays unavailable by default. An energy value is admitted only together with the identity of a
real measurement instrument; the framework does not derive joules from CPU time. The next slice is the
external adoption/rollback record plus paired causal ablations that reuse these identities and budgets.

### Increment 5 — mutate the mutation machinery

Only after architecture descent works, make the operators/search strategy themselves lineage-held and
content-addressed. A descendant may then improve how Genesis changes architectures, while the trust
root still decides whether that meta-change produced better externally measured descendants.

### Increment 6 — world/curriculum factory

Add a separate environment generator that produces new externally verifiable pressures near the
current capability frontier. Keep generation seeds, verifiers and hidden evaluation inaccessible to
the organism being judged.

## What would count as progress

A meaningful future result is not “Genesis generated a novel graph”. It should demonstrate at least:

1. a descendant architecture differs materially from its parent;
2. the difference is lineage-produced and survives restore;
3. it improves fresh capability or the capability/resource frontier under matched external budgets;
4. the gain disappears or weakens under an appropriate causal ablation;
5. later descendants inherit and build on the acquired machinery;
6. the evaluation/root-of-trust bytes and hidden cases remain outside the lineage.

Until those hold, this remains DEVELOPMENT apparatus.
