# Mira Genesis — Current Research Frontier

**Reader-facing status snapshot — 6 September 2026, after M124 closure and owner reconciliation.**

This is navigation only. Frozen protocols, immutable result artifacts, decisions and experiment-local
evidence remain authoritative. The superseded pre-sync frontier is preserved byte-for-byte at
[`state-history/CURRENT_RESEARCH_FRONTIER_PRE_SYNC_2026-09-05.md`](state-history/CURRENT_RESEARCH_FRONTIER_PRE_SYNC_2026-09-05.md).

## Where the active carrier line stands

M124/H69 is the latest merged carrier milestone. It is **closed without replay and untested**, not a
scientific negative.

The recent sequence is an apparatus-convergence line:

- M119/H64 spent one qualifying generation but the generated carrier bank was scientifically
  inadequate before either arm ran.
- M120/H65 moved that failure earlier: readiness discovered that the candidate schema required eight
  array-of-object levels while the route enforced five.
- M122/H67 flattened the contract and validated the live route: 9/9 capability probes conformed, but
  the inherited stress sizing produced 30,957 tokens against a 32,000 threshold, so the milestone
  closed `not_ready_stress` without a scientific generation.
- M123/H68 replaced the one-measurement sizing assumption with an empirical rate envelope. Its first
  167-station attempt truncated at at least 100,657 completion tokens, falsifying the prior linear fit.
  The prospectively chosen 109-station second attempt then landed at 50,232 tokens, inside its
  45,598–65,698 predicted envelope. The body was incomplete/malformed JSON and the frozen ladder
  classified that terminally as `not_ready_stress`.
- M124/H69 prospectively made content-bearing HTTP 200 responses with no `finish_reason` a delivery
  outcome. The decisive stress instead returned HTTP 200 with **no completion content at all**, so the
  new rule did not decide the run. The preserved verdict is `not_ready_delivery`.

The owner explicitly chose on 5 September 2026 to **close M124 without replay**. H69 remains untested.
No carrier bank, qualifying scientific invocation, reveal or scientific result exists for M124; the
preserved DEVELOPMENT readiness result remains authoritative.

## What M124 taught about the instrument

The archived observation is not rescored, but hostile review found five successor requirements:

1. bound every non-target string/array dimension in capability probes;
2. read and honor `Retry-After` from the transport's actual `response_headers` field;
3. use one definition of `did not answer`, so empty HTTP 200 delivery failures consume request-level
   retries before a whole-instrument delivery allowance slot;
4. treat truncation as an instrument/transport observation unless a predeclared rule can attribute it
   to the target feature;
5. freeze delivery/truncation/enforcement/stress precedence before any successor observation.

Any redesigned/pinned stress schema must be treated as **uncalibrated** and receive fresh prospective
calibration rather than being fit to M122/M123/M124 observations.

## Scientific throughput versus engineering throughput

The project is moving quickly at the instrument level but has not produced a new carrier-line
scientific observation during M113–M124. H58–H65 and H67–H69 remain untested. No generality gate
advances from those closures.

This remains productive convergence only while successive failures are genuinely narrower and old
records stay immutable. M124 preserved that discipline: its archived `not_ready_delivery` record was
not rewritten after later defects were discovered.

## Next carrier trigger

No successor is implied merely by documenting M124's defects. A later carrier milestone must be newly
numbered and prospectively frozen before new requests.

Its minimum boundary is already clear:

- carry forward the same never-yet-tested carrier proposition rather than silently changing the target;
- preserve the global delivery ceiling, now **4 of 6 spent**;
- fix the M124 transport/attribution defects before observing successor data;
- obtain fresh prospective calibration for any redesigned stress schema;
- keep DEVELOPMENT readiness distinct from a qualifying scientific generation;
- preserve every attempt and never use a later classifier to relabel M122–M124.

A future `ready` readiness result would still not constitute hypothesis support. Only the successor's
own frozen scientific chronology could then determine whether a qualifying carrier-bank experiment is
allowed.

## Separate frontier: M121/H66 and G7

M121/H66 remains preregistered and its canonical scientific run remains owner-gated. The 5 September
hostile review found pre-implementation degrees of freedom that can be closed without spending a
scientific attempt. A non-canonical prospective v2 design candidate exists at
[`audits/M121_V2_DESIGN_CANDIDATE_2026-09-05.md`](audits/M121_V2_DESIGN_CANDIDATE_2026-09-05.md).

The publication/IP gate itself is now resolved: **P-025 records `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` on
5 September 2026**. Prospective v2 hardening may therefore proceed publicly, but that disposition does
not authorize a canonical salt, one-shot scientific attempt, reveal or result acceptance. Even a
later positive H66 result would be bounded partial evidence and would not close G7 by itself.

## Publication/IP reconciliation

The previously open recent-line publication backlog is now recorded transparently, after disclosure
rather than falsely backdated:

| Ledger | Milestone | Disposition | Decision date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P-024 | M120 / H65 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-025 | M121 / H66 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-026 | M123 / H68 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-027 | M122 / H67 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |
| P-028 | M124 / H69 | `PUBLIC_AGPL_COMMERCIAL_OPTION` | 2026-09-05 |

The reconciliation is recorded at
[`IP_REVIEWS/OWNER_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-05.md`](IP_REVIEWS/OWNER_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-05.md).
Publication permission remains distinct from scientific execution authority.

## Armed but paused: M092/H38

M092's canonical search remains unresolved and `first_run_only`. Static integrity work is safe, but
advancing its cursor would continue the unique scientific observation. It therefore remains paused
until explicit owner authority is given for that specific action.

## External blockers

H21/M075 and H31/M085 remain genuinely external by claim definition. Their readiness checks fail
closed because the required independently maintained signed banks/protocols and independent
reproductions do not exist. The exact handoff is documented at
[`audits/EXTERNAL_VALIDATION_HANDOFF_2026-09-05.md`](audits/EXTERNAL_VALIDATION_HANDOFF_2026-09-05.md).
Internal or AI-authored replacements cannot satisfy those claims.

## Independent validation completed

The M095–M112 historical line has been replayed as far as its frozen contracts permit on fresh hosted
runners. M097, M099, M100, M104 and M107–M111 reproduce positive; M095, M098, M103 and M105 reproduce
negative; M112 reproduces mixed. M096, M101, M102 and M106 retain explicitly documented historical
portability limits rather than being silently repaired or reclassified.

M094/H39 needs one distinction that the original audit matrix did not preserve: its positive
qualification verdict reproduces, but **D063 remains unfilled**, so no H39 register claim has been
accepted. The original matrix is left unchanged and the navigation correction is recorded at
[`audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_CORRIGENDUM_2026-09-05.json`](audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_CORRIGENDUM_2026-09-05.json).

The original machine-readable matrix remains at
[`audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_MATRIX_2026-09-05.json`](audits/HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_MATRIX_2026-09-05.json).

## Claim boundary

Mira Genesis does not currently claim AGI, general intelligence, consciousness, unrestricted
self-rewrite, open-ended evolution, open-ended recursive self-improvement, unrestricted repository
authority or unrestricted network authority. The strongest positive results remain bounded,
predeclared mechanism results with explicit ceilings.
